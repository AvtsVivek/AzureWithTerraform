- Reference [is here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/external/latest/docs/data-sources/data_source). 

- The external provider in this case is bash script.

- Use bash to run the commands inside of commands.sh. Powershell does not work. You will get errors as mentioned in the [stackoverflow question here](https://stackoverflow.com/q/72953037/1977871).

# Ensure that a folder by name local-exec-output-files exists. Else it will throw error.
# Then open provisioner-output.txt inside of local-exec-output-files folder and look at the time. Note the time.

# Do this once again. Review the plan. 
# It will say, null_resource.null_resource_simple must be replaced 
# Contrast this with earlier example(2150200-null-resource-provisioner), the case when trigger is not present.

# Apply the plan. Then open provisioner-output.txt inside of local-exec-output-files folder and look at the time.
# Note the time. This time, the time should be different.
# Contrast this with earlier example(2150200-null-resource-provisioner), the case when trigger is not present.

# Yet again.
# It will say, null_resource.null_resource_simple must be replaced

# Summary
# triggers (Map of String) A map of arbitrary strings that, when changed, will force the null resource to be replaced, re-running any associated provisioners.
# So the each time when you plan and apply, the null resource will be triggered.

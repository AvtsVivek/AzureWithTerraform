# Ofcourse, the organization name must be created before hand.

# Ensure the organization is vivek-hcta-azure-demo1 and workspace is cli-driven-migrate-tfstate-to-tfcloud-demo.
# Also ensure environment variables are set. See the ReadMe.md file.
# Also ensure that there are no tfstate files in that workspace.
# Then ensure the following block is added to the terraform block in the .tf file.

# As the command executes, you should see this.
# Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy.
# So the tainted resource is destroyed and then recreated.
# This time, the file provisioner fails, but apply command is successful.

# Now, once the vms are provisioned
# Ensure that the vm is created and running. Get the ip address assigned. In this case its 20.198.64.249
# get the ip address of the vms. Also browse the following link to see the status of the vms:
# app1/index.html and also app1/metadata.html
# Now run the command. Run this on git bash.
# ssh -i ssh-keys/terraform-azure.pem azureuser@20.228.181.237
# Now you should be logged in. 

# From the virtual machine, you can run the following command 
cd /tmp

ls -lrt

# First observer file-copy.html. This file is copied from the local machine to the virtual machine.
# Then observe fle.log
cat file.log

# now cd into app1
cd app1

ls -lrt

# Now observe that the fifth provisioning is failed. There is no file-copy.html in the virtual machine.
